# Feature-Scaling-w-Multi-Variable-Gradient-Descent
Extend regression model routines to support multiple features w/ Feature Scaling included

# Introduction

- Extend regression model routines to support multiple features
- Extend data structures to support multiple features
- Rewrite prediction, cost and gradient routines to support multiple features


This contains 2 different codes. Run the multi-vari gradient descenet to get an idea of whats going on
and the limitations, and then use feature scaling to understand its importance.

Don't forget to load houses.txt in your files, it contains sample housing data.

The code is self informing along with information blocks to make it easier for user to understand
the math
